# Packaging the Game for Release

To make the game installable on any platform, we'll use *PyInstaller* to create standalone executables.

# Steps to Package the Game

    *Install PyInstaller*:
    ```
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

    *Package the Game*:
    * For *Windows*:
    ```

    *Locate the Executable*:
    * The executable will be created in the dist folder inside your project directory.

    *Include Assets*:
    * Make sure the pop.wav file is in the same directory as the executable, or modify the code to load it from a specific path.

    *Test the Executable*:
    * Run the executable on your platform to ensure it works correctly.

    *Create a Release*:
    * Zip the executable and any required assets (e.g., pop.wav).
    * Upload the zip file to the Releases page on GitHub.

# Example Release Workflow

    *Tag a Version*:
    ```
